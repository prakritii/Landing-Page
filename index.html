            <h3>Customer review</h3>
            <p>
                Been here twice now (not a local) and we will always keep coming back. Their chicken is great 
                but we love their frozen and ready-to-cook foods more. We recommend their butter tarts, frozen fruit pies, and frozen pot pies. 
                Family-run operation and as a result, they are kind and provide excellent service. 
                I'm sure locals would love for them to have longer opening hours.
